# Starbucks_Tip_Calculator

When I worked at starbucks, we would have to manually round the labor out for each employee, 
then after counting the moeny we would have to manually do the math to see how much each employee got tipped.
I decided to make a code so that ALL you have to do is inout the labor per person in order down the list,
then after you count the money, you input the dollar amount then it'll tell you how much the person got tipped.
